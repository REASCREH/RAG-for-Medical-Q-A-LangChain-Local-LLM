    "\n",
    "# 1. Precision and Accuracy:\n",
    "  The advanced LLM demonstrates a near-perfect ability to adhere to the prompt constraints, specifically the crucial instruction to \"answer ONLY based on the context.\" This eliminates previous issues like hallucination (e.g., mentioning \"retinal detachment\" when not in the source).\n",
